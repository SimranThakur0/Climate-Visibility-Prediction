    <h1>Climate Visibility Prediction</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2> 
    <p>This project aims to predict climate visibility based on weather parameters. It takes various environmental factors as inputs, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, and uses a machine learning model to estimate the visibility in kilometers. The project includes an interactive dashboard where users can input these parameters and receive a visibility prediction.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive web dashboard built with Flask</li>
        <li>Prediction based on real-time input data</li>
        <li>Simple and easy-to-use interface</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The user enters weather parameters into the form on the dashboard. Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to the model, and a visibility prediction is displayed. This prediction is calculated based on the trained machine learning model, which uses historical weather data to make accurate predictions.</p>
